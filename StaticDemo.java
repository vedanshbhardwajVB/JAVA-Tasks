/**
Static Keyword - 
1- In variables - This is used to create variables which have the same copy for all objkects of a class.
			Value of a static variable remains common for all the instances of the class.

2- In functions - Static functions are those functions that deal with static variables only. These functions don't need an object to be created before calling, because they are directly attached to the class and not any instance of the class.

3- A class can be made static only if it is a nested class.
	Nested static class doesnâ€™t need reference of Outer class
	A static class cannot access non-static members of the Outer class
